# This mini-project is based on the K-Means exercise from 'R in Action'

# Exercise 0: Install these packages if you don't have them already
install.packages(c("cluster", "rattle.data","NbClust"))
library(cluster)
# Now load the data and look at the first few rows
data(wine, package="rattle.data")
head(wine)

# Exercise 1: Remove the first column from the data and scale
# it using the scale() function
wine<-scale(wine[-1])
head(wine)
# Now we'd like to cluster the data using K-Means. 
# How do we decide how many clusters to use if you don't know that already?
# We'll try two methods.

# Method 1: A plot of the total within-groups sums of squares against the 
# number of clusters in a K-means solution can be helpful. A bend in the 
# graph can suggest the appropriate number of clusters. 

wssplot <- function(data, nc=15, seed=1234){
	              wss <- (nrow(data)-1)*sum(apply(data,2,var))
               	      for (i in 2:nc){
		        set.seed(seed)
	                wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(data, centers=i)$withinss)}

	                        ylab="Within groups sum of squares")

# Exercise 2:
#   * How many clusters does this method suggest?
#     This method suggests 3 clusters
#
#   * Why does this method work? What's the intuition behind it?
#     This Method requires the number of clusters is slected before the algorithm is run.
#     Then the method involves observing a set of clusters relative to how they minimise the Euclidean distance within the cluster. 
#     

#   * Look at the code for wssplot() and figure out how it works
#this function takes the dataframe, max no.of clusters (nc = 15) and a random seed.
#Calculates sum of kmeans within cluster sum of squares, for 2 - 15 clusters

# Method 2: Use the NbClust library, which runs many experiments
# and gives a distribution of potential number of clusters.

library(NbClust)

		            main="Number of Clusters Chosen by 26 Criteria")


# Exercise 3: How many clusters does this method suggest?
# three clusters 

# Exercise 4: Once you've picked the number of clusters, run k-means 
# using this number of clusters. Output the result of calling kmeans()
# into a variable fit.km

# fit.km <- kmeans( ... )
fit.km <- kmeans(wine, centers = 3)
# Now we want to evaluate how well this clustering does.

# Exercise 5: using the table() function, show how the clusters in fit.km$clusters
# compares to the actual wine types in wine$Type. Would you consider this a good
# clustering?
Diffe <- table(wine$Type, fit.km$cluster)
View(Diffe)

# Exercise 6:
# * Visualize these clusters using  function clusplot() from the cluster library
# * Would you consider this a good clustering?
